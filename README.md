# phone_number_generator
generates random phone numbers based on user input

This script was written in C.


To run, go to the directory where you downloaded the executable, and run ./phone\#s in the terminal
(there is supposed to be a forward slash after the 'e' in "phone".

You could also run this in Windows using the Linux subsystem for windows or another program such as mobaxterm.





executable file was compiled in linux using gcc

source code included, feel free to use this as you see fit.

I personally created this to practice regex.
